### 4. Project Summary

 **4.1. Description**

This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying artwork into various styles and predicting whether it was created by a human artist or generated by AI. The model will be trained on a dataset comprising paintings from the 14th to the 21st century, as well as AI-generated artworks. These artworks will span ten distinct artistic styles: Art Nouveau, Baroque, Expressionism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Realism, Renaissance, Romanticism, Surrealism, and Ukiyo-e. The  goal is to create a system that not only classifies artistic styles but also verifies the authenticity of paintings and evaluates their origin.

 **4.2. Dataset**

AI-ArtBench (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravidussilva/real-ai-art)  
AI-ArtBench is a dataset that contains 180,000+ art images. 60,000 of them are human-drawn art that was directly taken from ArtBench-10 dataset and the rest is generated equally using Latent Diffusion and Standard Diffusion models. Dataset also contains information about art style.

### Assignment progress discussion

**1. Dataset collection & preprocessing**

Dataset was collected from Kaggle. AI-ArtBench is a dataset that contains 180,000+ art images. 60,000 of them are human-drawn art that was directly taken from ArtBench-10 dataset and the rest is generated equally using Latent Diffusion and Standard Diffusion models. The human-drawn art is in 256x256 resolution and images generated using Latent Diffusion and Standard Diffusion has 256x256 and 768x768 resolutions respectively. Dataset already split into train and test parts and contains artworks from 10 different artistic styles. 

Processing: `datasets.preprocessing.py`
* Since the number of AI-generated artworks was higher in comparison to human ones, to balance the dataset I decided to select 5.000 images for each artistic style for each creation type (human, AI). Therefore, the final size of the training subset was (5.000 x 10 x2). Then I split the training subset into train and validation (90/10) and resized all the images to 256x256.
* Labels were created with the logic {AI/human}_{artistic_style_name}

Processing: `datasets.AIArtbench.py`
* To seamlessly use pytorch.DataLoader later dataset was prepared in a special way using `datasets.AIArtbench.py` that inherits the logic of the base class `datasets.dataset.py`

**2. Task & models**

The main goal of the project was to predict the artistic style and creation type (human/AI) of the artwork (= Image Classification Problem).
To solve the task the following models were selected:
* Simple 4-layer CNN as a baseline
* Fine-tuned ResNet18 model 

**3. Training setup**

The training setup was similar for all models:
* epochs: 10
* patience: 3
* validation frequency: 1
* learning rate: 0.001
* optimizer: SGD Optimizer
* loss function: Cross entropy loss function

The logic for model training and testing can be found in `trainers.ImgClassification.py`.
Helper functions to initialize the training and testing process are in `scripts.run_cnn.py`.
The training and validation process has been stored and tracked using WandB Logger  `scripts.wandb_logger.py`.

**4. Metrics**

Since the main task was related to multi-class classification the following metrics were used:

* For tracking training process: accuracy, multi-class accuracy
* For evaluating results of the test set: accuracy, multi-class accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, confusion matrix

The main metric was overall accuracy and the goal was to find an approach that would outperform the baseline
