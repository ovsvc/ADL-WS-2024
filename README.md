### 4. Project Summary

 **4.1. Description**

For this project, I plan to develop a deep learning model that classifies artwork into various styles. Additionally, I am considering an extension where the dataset is augmented with AI-generated art. In this extended version, the model would not only predict the art style but also classify whether the artwork was created by a human or by AI. However, I am unsure if this additional classification will be included in the final scope of the project.

 **4.2. Dataset**

Option 1: WikiArt Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steubk/wikiart/data)  
This dataset contains thousands of images across multiple art styles, it covers a wide range of art movements like Baroque, Renaissance, Modernism, and Abstract art.

Option 2: AI-ArtBench (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravidussilva/real-ai-art)  
AI-ArtBench is a dataset that contains 180,000+ art images. 60,000 of them are human-drawn art that was directly taken from ArtBench-10 dataset and the rest is generated equally using Latent Diffusion and Standard Diffusion models. Dataset also contains information about art style.
